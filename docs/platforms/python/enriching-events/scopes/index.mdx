When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it for your advantage.

## What's a Scope

Scopes manage the data that should be sent along with an event. For instance [contexts](../context/) or [breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on the scope.

There are three types of scopes:

- the *global scope*, which is a simple global variable that contains data relevant for the whole app (e.g., the release)
- *isolation scopes*, which are thread-local and are created for each request-response lifecycle
- *current scopes*, which are thread-local and follow the lifecycle of a span

The default SDK integrations will manage these scopes for you out of the box. For
instance, web framework integrations will create and destroy isolation scopes around your
routes or controllers.

As you start using the SDK, the initial scopes are created for you automatically.
When you call a global function such as <PlatformIdentifier name="capture-event" /> or <PlatformIdentifier name="set-tag" /> internally Sentry determines the correct scope to use to perform that functionality. At the end of the pipeline, the final event data is the result of merging the global scope and the isolation and current scope together, applying data from each in turn.

## Configuring the Scope

XXX: new scope vs. modifying current scope

You can call <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> at any point in
time to modify data stored on the scope. This is useful for doing things like
[modifying the context](../context/).

The most useful operation when working with scopes is the <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> context manager. It can be used to fork the current scope. It's very helpful if
you only want to send data for one specific event.

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[the context documentation](../context/).
