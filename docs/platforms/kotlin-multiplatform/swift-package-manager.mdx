Swift Package Manager is a powerful tool for managing dependencies in Swift that allows developers to enjoy a more native integration experience with Xcode.
If you already use Swift Package Manager or prefer it over other package managers on Apple platforms, this guide will show you how to install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK while using Swift Package Manager.

## Install

Integrating the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK while using Swift Package Manager might seem unconventional at first, especially if you're accustomed to using Swift Package Manager for all your dependencies. However, you can achieve a smooth integration by utilizing the Kotlin Cocoapods plugin specifically for compiling and building the shared framework, and then continue to manage all other dependencies with Swift Package Manager as usual.

Follow the steps on our primary installation method [CocoaPods](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/#install) to install the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK.

After you have consumed the shared framework in your application you can still continue without disrupting your existing workflow with Swift Package Manager for other dependencies.
