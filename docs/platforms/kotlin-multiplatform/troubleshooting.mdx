If you need help solving issues with your Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, you can read the edge cases documented below. If you need additional help, you can [ask on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-kotlin-multiplatform/issues/new/choose). Customers on a paid plan may also contact support.

## Tests not working

If you configured the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and tests are still failing with the following error: `ld: framework 'Sentry' not found` then follow these steps for the workaround:

### 1. Download the Sentry xcframework

Choose the release based on the version specified in the version compatibility table, download the `Sentry.xcframework.zip`, and unzip it.

### 2. Create Frameworks directory and insert Sentry.framework

Create a `/Frameworks` directory in the directory where the `test.kexe` resides. Put the `Sentry.framework` into it. (The `Sentry.framework` can be found inside of the `ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator`.)
The `test.kexe` will usually reside in `build/bin/iosSimulatorArm64/debugTest`.

### 3. Add the linker options

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
  listOf(
      iosX64(),
      iosArm64(),
      iosSimulatorArm64(),
  ).forEach {
      it.binaries.framework {
          baseName = "shared"
          isStatic = true
      }
      it.compilations.all {
          if (compilationName == "test" && target.platformType == KotlinPlatformType.native) {
              compilerOptions.configure {
                  freeCompilerArgs.add("-linker-options")
                  freeCompilerArgs.add("-F/your/path/Carthage/Build/Sentry.xcframework/ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/")
              }
          }
      }
  }
```

### 4. Run the tests

Now your tests should run successfully.
