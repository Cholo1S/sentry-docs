When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it for your advantage.

## What's a Scope

Scopes manage the data that should be sent along with an event. For instance [contexts](../context/) or [breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on the scope.

There are three types of scopes:

- the *global scope*, which is a simple global variable that contains data relevant for the whole app (e.g., the release)
- *isolation scopes*, which are thread-local and are created for each request-response lifecycle
- *current scopes*, which are thread-local and follow the lifecycle of a span

The default SDK integrations will manage these scopes for you out of the box. For
instance, web framework integrations will create and destroy isolation scopes around your
routes or controllers.

When you call a global function such as <PlatformIdentifier name="capture-event" /> or <PlatformIdentifier name="set-tag" />, the SDK internally determines the correct scope to use to perform that functionality. At the end of the pipeline, the final data applied to the event is the result of merging the global scope and the isolation and current scope together, applying data from each in turn.

## Changing the Scope

The most useful operation when working with scopes is using the <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> context manager. It can be used to fork the current scope, apply modifications to the new scope as long as the context manager is active, and then return to the original scope afterwards. This is helpful if you only want to send data for one specific event, for instance for doing things like [modifying the context](../context/). It's roughly equivalent to the <PlatformIdentifier name="push-scope" /> context manager in earlier (1.x) versions of the SDK.

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[the context documentation](../context/).
