The .NET SDK provides an integration for [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/) to monitor your jobs by automatically creating check-ins for them. The SDK relies on job filters that get set up when you `UseSenty` like so

```csharp
using Hangfire;
using Sentry.Hangfire;

GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSentry();
```

or if you're using the builder pattern

```csharp
using Hangfire;
using Sentry.Hangfire;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddHangfire(configuration => configuration
    .UseSentry() // <- Add Sentry to automatically send check-ins
);
```

To let the SDK know which jobs to monitor you need to provide the job with a monitor slug. This can be done by setting the `SentryMonitorSlug` attribute on the job. An example how to set up a fire-and-forget job that is getting monitored by Sentry could look like the following snippet:

```csharp
using Hangfire;
using Sentry.Hangfire;

GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSentry();
BackgroundJob.Enqueue<MyJobClass>(job => job.Execute());

public class MyJobClass
{
    [SentryMonitorSlug("my-monitor-slug")]
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Do your work
    }
}
```
